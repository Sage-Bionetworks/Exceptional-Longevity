# Exceptional Longevity Code Repository

This repository should be used to store scripts for data curation and backend portal drivers for the ELITE Portal.

Examples of some R scripts that could be added: code for validating metadata, updating backend tables that drive Cohort Builder, adding bulk annotations to files, merging metadata files, and more. 

README to be updated as we determine the structure of the ELITE repo.
